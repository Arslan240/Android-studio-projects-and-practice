1. Constraint Layout is an advanced layout and it was introduced in 2016.
2. In constraint layout we can't add nested layouts. It can only hold views and viewGroups but not any layouts.
3. To add constraints just click and drag the point at the 4 sides of the element and attatch it to the surface.
4. To delete a constraint."Ctrl + click" the constraint. Or right click on the element and delete all constraints.
5. Verical and Horizontal Guidelines = These are guidelines just like we have in illustrator to aligh things evenly.
   We can set guidelines and when we apply constraints to that guidelines.

6. layout_width = match-constraint. When we set the layout width of the element as match constraint.
   then it's width will shrink or grow based on the constraints.

7. We can create a fb page cover and dp style thingy by setting the upper constraint to the bottom of the upper
   element and also setting the lower constraint of the lower element to the lower side of the upper object. In this way
   the lower element's center will be at the bottom of the upper object.
