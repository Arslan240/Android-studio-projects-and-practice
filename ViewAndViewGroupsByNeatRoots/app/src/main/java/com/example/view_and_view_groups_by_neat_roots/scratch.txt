        **** VIEW ****
1- View is the base of the User Interfaces in Android. We make it from View class.
2- View is a single entity which means we can't add any other widgets or components to it.
3- View takes up a rectangular space on screen.It is responsible for drawings and event Handling.
4- View is the base class of widgets (Which are used to create UI components like buttons, textfields etc.)

        **** VIEWGROUP ****
1- ViewGroup is a subclass of View.
2- We can add widgets, controls, buttons other ViewGroups and also Views to it.

        **** LAYOUTS (View Containers) ****
1- Layouts are subclasses of ViewGroup. There are many types of layouts. e.g. Constraint Layout, Horizontal layout, vertical layout etc.
2- Layouts are also called View Containers. Because they can contain other layouts, ViewGroups, controls, views etc,
3- Layouts are invisible containers and they only have like width and height. Because they are serving the purpose of containing other components.
4- android:layout_weight = when we assign an element a weight of some value don't assign any value to other elements in the row. Then the element with no weight will only take
   sufficient space for it's contents to display and remaining space will be divided into 1 part and will be occupied by the element with some weight.
   If we have 3,4 elements, then the total space will be divided into pieces according to the weight.
   EXAMPLE OF LAYOUT WEIGHT:
            e.g: e1:2 ,e2:1, e3:3 , e4:not assigned.
            In this case e4 will have wrap-content by default hopefully and take only sufficient space to display.
            e1, e2, and e3 --> 2+1+3 = 6. The remaining screen will be divided into 6 parts and every element
              will occupy the screen according to weight defined.
